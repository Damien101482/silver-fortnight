    descriptionFull : "This spell transforms a creature you can see within range into a new beast form. An unwilling creature must make a Wisdom saving throw to avoid the effect. A shapechanger automatically succeeds on this saving throw.  The transformation lasts for the duration, or until the target drops to 0 hit points or dies. The new form can be any beast of CR 1 or less that does not have a fly speed. While in this new form, the target is charmed by you and views you as a trusted ally. The target can understand simple commands such as “attack” or “stay.” The charm affects creatures that are immune to charm in their normal form. The charm ends immediately when the target reverts to its normal form.  The target’s game statistics, including mental ability scores, are replaced by the statistics of the chosen beast. It retains its alignment and personality. The creature is limited in the actions it can perform by the nature of its new form, and it can’t speak, cast spells, or take any other action that requires hands or speech. The creature's gear melds into its new form. The creature can’t activate, use, wield, or otherwise benefit from any of its equipment.  The target assumes the hit points of its new form. When it reverts to its normal form, the creature returns to the number of hit points it had before it transformed. If it reverts as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to its normal form."

A dragon that has been bonded can never be bonded with another target. Likewise, this spell cannot be used to bond more than one dragon to any individual.  Wyrmlings cannot be used as mounts until they grow into young dragons. A dragon cannot use legendary actions while it is being used as a mount.  Controlling the Dragon. Your dragon moves and acts on your initiative. You can decide how the dragon moves and attacks. While your dragon is fighting alongside you, it loses its multiattack feature. If your dragon has a breath weapon, it can be used once, and it recharges after you and the dragon complete a long rest.  If your bonded dragon dies, you will also die within 24 hours unless the dragon is returned to life. You cannot be raised from the dead unless your bonded dragon is alive.
